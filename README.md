# CarSale_DL_W1
In this task, we predict the value of a potential car sale (i.e. how much a particular person will spend on buying a car) for a customer based on the following attributes: Age, Gender, Average miles driven per day, Personal debt, and Monthly income. We will use Feedforward Neural Network (FNN) using Keras.
